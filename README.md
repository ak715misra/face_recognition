## Project: Face Recognition

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `pca_mini_project.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `lfw.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `face_recognition/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook pca_mini_project.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook pca_mini_project.ipynb
```
or
```bash
python pca_mini_project.py
```

This will execute the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser or the python script would be run on the command terminal.
